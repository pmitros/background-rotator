Rotate Background
=================

This is a trivial utility to rotate the background images *when I'm
not looking*. Specifically, this is done whenever my monitor falls
asleep.

`dpms.pl` calls `rot.pl` whenever the monitor falls asleep. DPMS in X
doesn't trigger any events, so we just probe the state every minute.

`rot.pl` runs a random command from a file called `commands`

`command.pl` generates the appropriate command for a jpg for a screen
of my resolution (1600x1024). `commands` was generated by running
`find ./ |xargs -n1 ./command.pl>commands`, and then manually adjusting the
offsets for cropping.

Requires:

* perl
* The Perl X11::Protocol module
* The Perl X11::Protocol::Ext::DPMS extension
